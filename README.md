Description

The data includes environmental information, geographical location and size spectrum slopes of 1,095 stream fish communities in France sampled between 2015 and 2018. Stream fish communities were sampled using electrofishing following standardized protocols in streams. Size spectra were calculated using two common techniques: one using the ordinary-least-square linear regression and the other using maximum likelihood estimates. The data is a subset of the original data by the Office Français de la Biodiversité (Irz et al. 2022).

Structure

The data contains two Excel files (.csv format):

0_Data_Dictionary: Description of each variable.

1_Stream_Location: Environmental and biotic information on each stream community.
